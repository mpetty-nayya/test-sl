# Introduction

This documentation will guide you through how to embed Nayya’s decision support into your platform. Nayya’s decision support helps employees select the right benefits and plans and gives them the personalized, data-driven, guidance they need to make the best decisions.

How does it work? Nayya takes the employee through a brief and dynamic 12-15 question journey to understand their unique lifestyle, financial profile, and family profile, while merging in data about that consumer and relevant risk and utilization data behind the scenes. This helps us guide employees on the plans they need, educate them on benefits that might be relevant to them, and provide coverage amount recommendations to best protect them.
