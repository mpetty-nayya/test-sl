# Errors

Nayya uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of an API request.  In general, codes in the `2xx` range indicate success.  Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error with the provided information (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a business rule failed, etc.).  Codes in the 5xx range indicate an  error with Nayya servers.
