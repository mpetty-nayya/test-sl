## Authentication

### How do I Replace a JWT Token

If you have a key that needs to be rolled because of a security breach or because of your security protocols, or because you lost you JWT Token, you may contact api@nayya.com

## Errors

### How do contact Nayya about an error I don't understand

`409` and `422` errors should provide enough information to fix the error without contacting Nayya.

`5xx` errors should be rare but sometimes provide enough information to prevent contacting Nayya.

Contact nayya by emailing api@nayya.com with the [Request-Id](RequestIds.md) and a short description of the issue.
