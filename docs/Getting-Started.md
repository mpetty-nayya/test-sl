# Getting-Started

Nayya fits into your existing user flow to empower a seamless user experience. See the diagram below to see an overview.

As you can see, your platform hands off to Nayya for decision support with the expected outcome being a set of plans bookmarked by the employee. Your platform can then retrieve those plans to create a great user experience and enable employees to make the best elections for themselves and their families.

Integrating in this way with Nayya is really quite simple, and we'll go through each step in detail.

    You'll perform three main steps:
    1. Mapping your system's entities to ours
    2. Writing requests to configure employers and employees in Nayya
    3. Embed our user experience into yours

**That's it!**
Let's look at this in more detail.
